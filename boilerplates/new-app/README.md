# <<name>>

<<name>> is a web application built with the
[Lighter MVC](http://lighter.io/lighter) framework.

## Running the server

There are several ways to run the <<name>> application, the simplest
of which is to run the following inside the <<name>> directory:

```bash
node app
```

Or if you're running the application in a development environment, and you
would like to see full logging as well as trigger an auto-restart when
server changes are made, you may want to run:
```bash
lighter dev
```

### The `lighter` CLI
[Lighter MVC](http://lighter.io/lighter) includes a command-line interface
which you should install globally:
```
npm install -g lighter
```

The <<name>> application can be run in multiple environments:


The server can also be run with 2 different executables.
`debug`, `dev`, `test`, `stage`, `canary` and `prod`. Also, the server
can be run directly with `node` () start the server,
install `lighter` globally: <<port>>
Lighter is influenced by the PHP framework CodeIgniter, in that by default, controllers
and their methods will automagically get added to the router based on their names and
where they are found under the controllers directory. This means you don't have to
write a ton of routing code, and you know where to find a controller method if you
know its URL, and vice versa.
